    description " Translating to ''sitting in the cellar'', Challerhocker is washed in wine and spices and then aged for a minimum of 10 months, providing a remarkable depth of flavor. Firm yet creamy, this is a wonderful melter and is great for an extra exciting grilled cheese or as a way to liven up your fondue. More about Challerhocker: Our friend Walter Rass, an experienced cheesemaker, has a passion for quality which has won him one of the top 2 spots in the local competition among Appenzeller cheesemakers for 15 of the last 20 years. His gem has the rich aroma of cooked custard, the flavor of slowly roasted nuts, and a lingering almost fruity finish. Close your eyes and you will sense the mountains around you and smell the alpine flowers.Unwilling to rest on his unrivaled record, Walter's pioneering instinct has led him to test new varieties to see what else can evolve from his exceptional combination of milk and cheesemaking magic. His hard work and our patience have been rewarded with a new cheese, Challerhocker, which literally means ''sitting in the cellar''. This new cheese combines many of the tricks from his Appenzeller, with a some extra cream and some additional age (12 months vs 8 to10). The Challerhocker features a flavor veering more in the butterscotchy direction, with more nuttiness and less fruit than his Appenzeller. Both are amazing and on every cheese lovers ''must try'' list.'"
